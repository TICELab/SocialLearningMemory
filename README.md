‘Social learning and memory’ by Madeleine Ammar, Laurel Fogarty, Anne Kandler

Abstract: The adaptability of human populations to changing environments is often attributed to the human capacity for social learning, innovation, and culture. In rapidly changing environments it has been shown that maintaining high levels of cultural variation is beneficial because it allows for efficient adaptation. However, in many theoretical models, a high level of cultural variation also implies that a large amount of useless and perhaps detrimental information must be maintained and used, leading to lower population fitness in general. Here, we begin to investigate this often conflicting relationship between adaptation and cultural variation. We explicitly allow for the interplay between social learning and environmental variability, alongside the capacity for `memory', i.e. the storage, retrieval, and forgetting of information. Here, memory allows individuals to retain \textit{unexpressed} cultural variation, which does not directly impact adaptation. We show that this capacity for memory facilitates the evolution of social learning across a broader range of circumstances than previously thought. Results from this analysis may help to establish whether and when memory should be incorporated into cultural evolutionary models focused on questions of adaptation. 

Code 

All code is implemented in Matlab. The script MemoryModel_AmmarFogartyKandler.m can be used to generate populations using the simulation model described in the paper.
